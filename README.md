## Initialization Functions

### OnInit()

This function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. It initializes the neural network and the Kohonen Networks.

### OnDeinit(const int reason)

This function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. It deinitializes the neural network and the Kohonen Networks.

## Trading Functions

### OnTick()

This function is called on each tick of the market. It analyzes the market and trains the algorithm using the NeuralNetworkTrain() function. It then uses the NeuralNetworkPredict() function to make a trading decision and executes a buy or sell trade accordingly using the ExecuteBuyTrade() or ExecuteSellTrade() functions.

### ExecuteBuyTrade()

This function is called when a buy trade is executed. It contains the code for executing a buy trade.

### ExecuteSellTrade()

This function is called when a sell trade is executed. It contains the code for executing a sell trade.

## Neural Network Functions

### NeuralNetworkInit()
